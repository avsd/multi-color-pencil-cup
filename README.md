Pencil for pencils! A realistically-looking pencil-cup,
especially if printed using wood filament.

Adaptation of the original 
[Multi-Color Pencil Cup](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2536528)
model, with following changes:

* Changed the way parts of the model are connected: they fit one into the other,
so it can be printed in two parts, and no gluing is required.
* Reduced bottom thickness, so that it could be printed without infill.
* Converted to OpenSCAD format, making it customizable.

## Variants

The model comes in two variants. Both look identical from the outside.
You may choose one or the other depending on which filament you prefer to save.

### Variant 1

* larger ["wooden" part](./pencil-cup-v1-wood.stl)
* smaller ["color" part](./pencil-cup-v1-color.stl)

with the inner part completely "wooden", and a thin "color" shell wrapping it:

### Variant 2

* smaller ["wooden" part](./pencil-cup-v2-wood.stl)
* larger ["color" part](./pencil-cup-v2-color.stl)

with "wooden" top fittin on top of the "color" bottom.

## Print settings

* 0.2mm is recommended
* no support required
* no infill required (can be set to 0%, making it hollow)
